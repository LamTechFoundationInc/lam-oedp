"Reduce Cost on Travelling","Over the last 10 years, overseas travel was an expanding Government area. Despite the cosmetic austerity measures, reports show that the travel budget after austerity is higher than the preausterity period. For example, the attendance of the President to UN, AU or ECOWAS Summits cost over Le4.0 billion in each case. Overseas travel expenses across the MDAs are uncontrollably higher, estimated at over Le250 billion or more than $30 million a year. We recognize that it may be impossible to reduce overseas travel to zero. However, in order to to make savings the following measures will be adopted:

Government delegations will be reduced or streamlined to the minimum-value for money travels
	Quarterly budget performance report on the outcomes compared to estimates of MDAs will be published
	Use of Sierra Leone diplomatic missions to represent Government except where there are unavoidable statutory meetings that lead to net economic benefits

"Procurement and Maintenance of Vehicles","It is reported there are 100,000 vehicles registered by Government and related institutions. These exclude those registered under parastatals using private number plates. The purchasing cost of the vehicles, which are mainly SUVs, is around $65,000 to $110,000 each (Government prices). First problem, the vehicles are excessively overpriced. For example, a V6 Land Cruiser or Prado costs Government around Le660 million for 5 years covering high purchase price, customs duty/tax waiver/insurance and repairs. V8 Toyota Land Cruiser will cost Government Le1.09 billion in 5 years. We estimate that 10,000 vehicles cost is around Le6.6 trillion. Reducing this cost by at least 50% will make Le3.3 trillion in 5 years.

Concrete measures will include reducing spending on purchase of V8 vehicles, introducing pool vehicle system in the public sector; staff bus service for junior workers and vehicle loan system for certain categories of public sector workers.","Financing the New Direction, Measures to Control Expenditure","Mr.  Julius  Maada  Bio  - SLPP - 2018 - Presidential","On 25th, April 2018, The Statehouse released ""Executive Order Number Two Immediate Expenditure Control Measures"". ",internal:/sites/default/files/2018-05/executive-order-2-immediate-expenditure-control-measures-25th-april-2018.pdf,"In Progress"
"Goods and Services","The goods and services expenditures are mainly recurrent expenditures, wages and salaries and debt service payments. They include vehicles, utilities (telecom, electricity, water facilities, housing), travels, procurement of drugs and medical supplies. This is where we have very large leakages and unbudgeted expenditures. These are the areas that should be tackled decisively to make the required savings for financing poverty related activities","Financing the New Direction, Measures to Control Expenditure","Mr.  Julius  Maada  Bio  - SLPP - 2018 - Presidential","On 25th, April 2018, The Statehouse released ""Executive Order Number Two Immediate Expenditure Control Measures"". ",internal:/sites/default/files/2018-05/executive-order-2-immediate-expenditure-control-measures-25th-april-2018.pdf,"In Progress"
"Control of the Wage Bill","Uncontrolled wages and salaries caused by bloated public sector through presidential appointments and establishment of commissions that largely usurp the line Ministries’ functions, unregulated wage increases, double or triple dipping of salaries and pension as well as uncoordinated recruitment across the public sector.

If we are to restore credibility to the service, we must coordinate the wage bill. If we are to enhance staff moral and improve on service delivery, we must control the wage bill. Wages and Salaries must be harmonized on the basis of fairness and equity in the use of public resources. A commissioner or a director or director general must have an aligned appropriate grading within the civil service comparable to other public sector workers, payroll verification exercise between

Government and NASSIT, public sector workers on Government payroll will be assigned biometric photos and personalized pin codes linked to NASSIT numbers. These measures, when implemented will lead to substantial savings to finance our programs. This will provide substantial savings to the Budget.","Financing the New Direction, Measures to Control Expenditure","Mr.  Julius  Maada  Bio  - SLPP - 2018 - Presidential","On 25th, April 2018, The Statehouse released Executive ""Order Number Two Immediate Expenditure Control Measures""

"Revenue Mobilisation","The overall objectives of the New Direction for revenue mobilization is to increase domestic revenue from the current 11.1% of GDP to 20% of GDP within 3 years and to build a fair, a transparent and accountable tax system that promotes investment and growth. Our key strategy is to push for better taxation collection rather than imposing new taxation. Such efforts hold the potential to stimulate growth and investment whilst also allowing for increased levels of tax collection. Specifically, the following shall be the focus:

Review existing tax laws, agreements, policies and strategies to ensure that they meet the objectives of maximising tax revenue collection as well as impacting on the well-being of all Sierra Leoneans, especially low-income earners and small business enterprises
	All holders of elective office and political appointees, including the President and Vice President will pay tax on their earnings to ensure fairness in the tax system
	Develop and legislate a National Tax Policy that articulates how the Sierra Leone Tax The system will look like in terms of focus, administration and rate changes in the medium term.The new National Tax Policy will ensure the coordination and harmonisation of taxing authorities in the country to avoid the multiplicity of taxes.

	Enforce the Fiscal Accountability and Management Act that obligates all MDAs to transfer all funds to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. To this end, the new SLPP administration will immediately commence the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system that would allow Government to aggregate receipts from all government sources in order to give a better oversight of public finances, improve cash management and reduce reliance on bank financing.
	Mandate the NRA and the Ministry of Finance to upload on a regular basis tax information on revenue collection by sectors, tax rates particularly on frequently imported commodities, assessment and rate of tax compliance by sector
	Further strengthen the tax administration core processes, specifically in the areas of filing, assessment and payment and in dispute resolution

	Develop and create strategic partnerships with crypto currency and crowd funding platforms through smart contracts using block chain technology to raise funds by pledging unexploited mineral deposits (gold, diamonds and rare earths) and using the funds to reinvest in social programmes like health care and education
	Enforce tax laws especially rental income taxation and ensure timely settlement of all tax obligations. For rental income tax, update rental income tax database using the existing database on holding and letting agents, and conduct field audits on rented apartments and houses","Improving the Macro-economy, Transforming the Economy","Mr.  Julius  Maada  Bio  - SLPP - 2018 - Presidential",,,"Not Started"
"Measures to Mobilise Additional Revenue","Our broad strategy is therefore to push for better taxation collection rather than imposing new taxation. We commit to increase domestic revenue to 20% over 3 years. Such efforts hold the potential to stimulate growth and investment whilst also allowing for increased levels of tax collection.Specifically, the following shall be the focus:

We intend to reduce these waivers by at least 50% in the first two years and level around 25-30% in 3rd to 5th year. These alone will provide additional revenue of around Le150 billion per year.  All holders of elective office and political appointees including the President and Vice President will pay tax on their earnings to ensure fairness in the tax system. This will generate additional taxes of at least Le15.0 billion per year.
	We will implement ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) fully like in other countries, generating additional resources of about Le35.0 billion yearly.
	Implement without delay the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system that would allow Government to aggregate receipts from all government sources in order to give a better oversight of public finances, improve cash management and reduce reliance on bank financing.
	Implement the Carbon Trade facility; this will yield an estimated annual revenue of US$60.0 million or Le450.0 billion","Financing the New Direction, Measures to Mobilise Additional Resources","Mr.  Julius  Maada  Bio  - SLPP - 2018 - Presidential",,,"Not Started"

This approach will ensure inclusiveness and that the money spent on infrastructure development will bring about radical and major development across all sectors, thereby meaningfully transforming the lives of the people of Sierra Leone. For example, wherever a new road is constructed under the SLPP government, provisions will be made to ensure that along the same road corridor or alignment, there is a pipeline for fibre optic to improve ICT connectivity, or a pipeline for water to provide clean drinking water, transmission lines to transmit electricity to provide power and adequate electricity, industrial development such as manufacturing plants and factories, to provide jobs to improve the economy, agro-processing plants to ensure food security, access to other modes of transport such as in-land waterways, and rail and air access (as part of our future development plan). Therefore, by using this approach the construction of a single road will radically transform Sierra Leone by ensuring cross-sectoral and integrated infrastructure development. This will justify the amount spent on building the road rather than the current silo effect perpetuated by the APC government. Specifically, the SLPP administration will:

Promote and implement a holistic integrated infrastructure and sectoral development programme that will maximize the utility and effectiveness of infrastructure, thus greatly contributing to the overall socio-economic development of the country regardless of region.
